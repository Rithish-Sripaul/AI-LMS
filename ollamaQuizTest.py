    Generate {num_questions} multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on the topic: "{topic}".
    ### **Instructions:**
    - Generate exactly **{num_questions}** MCQs based on the provided content.
    - Each MCQ should be **clear, well-structured, and non-repetitive**.
    - Ensure that questions **test understanding**, not just recall.
    - Provide **four answer choices** (`option_1` to `option_4`), making them **plausible yet distinct**.
    - Ensure **one correct answer**, marked as `correct_option` (1, 2, 3, or 4).
    - **Vary the difficulty level**: Include a mix of **basic, intermediate, and advanced** questions.
    - **Avoid ambiguity**: Each question must have only **one clearly correct answer**.
    - **Return only JSONâ€”no explanations, no extra text.**
    Provide the output strictly in JSON format with the following structure:

    [
      {{
        "id": "<unique_question_id>",
        "quiz_head_id": "{quiz_head_id}",
        "question": "<Generated MCQ Question>",
        "option_1": "<First Option>",
        "option_2": "<Second Option>",
        "option_3": "<Third Option>",
        "option_4": "<Fourth Option>",
        "correct_option": "<Correct Option Number (1/2/3/4)>"
      }},
      ...
    ]
    Ensure that the questions are diverse and relevant to the topic. No need to include anything other than the question and options. Give me only the JSON.
